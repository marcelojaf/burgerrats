  <overview>
    BurgerRats is a mobile gamification app for burger enthusiasts, inspired by the GymRats app concept. The app allows users to create and join leagues (ligas) where they compete with friends by doing daily check-ins when eating burgers. Each check-in requires photo proof to be validated and grants one point in the league ranking. The competitive social aspect encourages friendly rivalry among burger lovers, creating a fun and engaging experience around the shared activity of enjoying hamburgers. Key goals include: fostering social connections through shared food experiences, gamifying burger consumption with a competitive points system, ensuring authenticity through mandatory photo verification, and limiting to one check-in per day to maintain fair competition.
